# Android Release QA Matrix (WI-303)

Date: 2026-03-15  
Device: OPPO CPH2381 (`9dd62e84`)  
ADB binary: `/mnt/c/Temp/android-platform-tools/platform-tools/adb.exe`

## Runtime setup used

- Metro host runtime: `/home/ubuntu/starlog/apps/mobile`
- Dev-client URL: `exp+starlog://expo-development-client/?url=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A8081`
- Port forwarding:
  - `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081`
  - `adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000`

## Matrix

| Flow | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dev-client app launch on physical phone | PASS | `docs/evidence/mobile/wi-303-smoke-after-reinstall.png` |
| Android smoke script end-to-end (deep-link + text share intents) | PASS | `docs/evidence/mobile/wi-303-smoke-log.txt` |
| Deep-link capture intent delivery (`starlog://capture?...`) | PASS | `docs/evidence/mobile/wi-303-smoke-log.txt` |
| Text share intent delivery (`android.intent.action.SEND`) | PASS | `docs/evidence/mobile/wi-303-smoke-log.txt` |
| App renders companion UI post-install | PASS | `docs/evidence/mobile/wi-303-smoke-final.png` |
| Metro connectivity stability (toast-free) | PARTIAL | `docs/evidence/mobile/wi-303-smoke-final.png` (toast: `Cannot connect to Metro...`) |

## Discovered blockers and mitigations

1. Initial runtime failed with `Cannot find native module 'ExpoSecureStore'` from the previously installed debug APK.
   - Mitigation: rebuilt `apps/mobile/android` with current dependencies (`./gradlew assembleDebug`) and reinstalled APK.
2. On this device/host pair, LAN relay startup can race and produce repeated connection refusals before Metro is actually listening.
   - Mitigation: use localhost dev-client URL + explicit `adb reverse tcp:8081` to make bundling deterministic.
3. Device shell cannot persist `stayon usb` because secure setting writes are restricted.
   - Mitigation: keep phone manually unlocked throughout validation.
